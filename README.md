Replace C:\path\to\your\directory with the actual path to the directory where your files are located. This script will create folders with the same names as the files present in that directory. If a folder with the same name already exists, it will print a message indicating that it failed to create the folder.
This script will not only create folders based on the names of the files present in the specified directory but also move each file into its respective folder.

Save this modified script as a .bat file and run it from the Command Prompt. It will automatically create folders based on the names of the files present in the specified directory and move the files into their respective folders.
Last : just put the Bat file inside the folder that you're willing to use
